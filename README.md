# Unsupervised-Learning-Global-Air-Pollution-Analysis

## Project Title: Predicting Dwelling Ownership in Washington State: A Support Vector Machine Approach

## Abstract:

This project investigates the trends in global air pollution from 1960 to 2022. By analyzing historical air quality data, the project aims to identify key patterns and factors that contribute to air pollution on a global scale. The analysis includes data processing, trend visualization, and insights into how pollution levels have changed over time and across different regions. This information may be useful for environmental scientists, policy makers, and public health officials to understand and mitigate air quality issues worldwide.

## Project Structure:

Unsupervised-Learning-Global-Air-Pollution-Analysis.ipynb: The Jupyter notebook containing data preprocessing, analysis, and visualizations of air pollution trends.
Unsupervised-Learning-Global-Air-Pollution-Analysis-Report.pdf: A detailed report summarizing the objectives, methodology, results, and insights of the project.
Dataset Zip Files: The dataset comprising historical air quality metrics, such as pollutant levels, across multiple regions.
README.md: This file, providing an overview of the project and instructions for replication.

## Installation:

Clone the repository with the following command:

git clone https://github.com/jananikrishnamurthy17/Unsupervised-Learning-Global-Air-Pollution-Analysis.git

Load the data file into the project via Google Drive or any other preferred method.

Run the code in Unsupervised-Learning-Global-Air-Pollution-Analysis.ipynb to perform the analysis.

## Dataset:

The dataset includes pollution metrics like PM2.5, NO2, and CO levels, with data spanning multiple countries and regions from 1960 to 2022. These features provide a comprehensive view of global pollution trends over time.

## Methodology:

Data Preprocessing: Cleaned the dataset by addressing missing values, formatting dates, and handling outliers to ensure reliable analysis.
Trend Analysis: Visualized long-term trends in pollution levels across regions and identified peak pollution periods.
Statistical Analysis: Applied statistical techniques to assess the relationship between pollution levels and potential contributing factors such as industrial growth.

## Results:

Significant trends were identified, including increases in pollutant levels in industrial regions and reductions in certain areas due to regulatory interventions. Key patterns were observed, showing the impact of economic factors on air pollution.

## Conclusion:
The analysis provides a detailed overview of global air pollution trends, offering insights into factors that influence air quality. These findings could aid in formulating data-driven environmental policies and strategies aimed at reducing air pollution.
